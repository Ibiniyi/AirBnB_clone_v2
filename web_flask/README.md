What are web frameworks and why you need them?
Web applications have evolved at a rate that the usability and interactivity they provide rival that of a native application. The technology and the expertise needed to build tailored solutions that reach this level of proficiency is demanding. Thankfully, there are tools that make web application development easier, one of them being a web app framework.

Here we look into what constitutes a web application framework and why you need it.

What are web application frameworks?
GeeksforGeeks describes ‘web application frameworks’ or ‘web frameworks’ as “a software framework that is designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources and web APIs”. In simple words, web frameworks are a piece of software that offers a way to create and run web applications. Thus, you don’t need to code on your own and look for probable miscalculations and faults.

In earlier days of web app development, web frameworks were introduced as a means to end hand-coding of applications where just the developer of a particular app could change it. That was long ago, now we have web-specific languages and the trouble with changing an app’s structure is resolved because of the arrival of a general performance. Now, depending upon your task you may choose one web framework that fulfills all your requirements or converges multiple frameworks.
